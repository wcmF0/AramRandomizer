A simple web app designed to address a specific challenge in custom ARAM games:

In standard ARAM, players typically get 2 rerolls, creating a pool of 15 champions. However, this feature is unavailable in custom games. This app solves the issue by randomly generating 15 unique champions for each team. Additionally, it includes a handy feature to view buffs and nerfs for champions.
